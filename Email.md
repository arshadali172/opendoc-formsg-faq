## What classification of data can FormSG handle?

If your per-entry data is Restricted, but the whole collection of data is Confidential, FormSG has you covered. This is because FormSG is a Restricted system that can manage Restricted data flowing through it, but ultimately data is stored in SG-Mail, which is a Confidential system that lets you store Confidential collections of data.
