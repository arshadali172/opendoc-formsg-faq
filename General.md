## What is FormSG?

FormSG is a form builder tool for government to self-service and create online forms that capture classified data, with the goal of replacing paper forms. Till date, it has replaced thousands of paper forms and are used by over 70 agencies such as MOM, MOE, PA and SportSG. Thousands of public officers are already on it. There is no onboarding process. Officers with @gov.sg emails can sign up.

## How does FormSG handle classified data?

FormSG can capture classified data, because it does not store them. FormSG forwards each form response directly to your Outlook mailbox. You then use the FormSG Data Collation Tool on https://form.app.gov.sg on the Intranet to collate email form responses into an Excel spreadsheet. This tool does not collect your classified data; it simply does the collation on your web browser.

## What classification of data can FormSG handle?

If your per-entry data is Restricted, but the whole collection of data is Confidential, FormSG has you covered. This is because FormSG is a Restricted system that can manage Restricted data flowing through it, but ultimately data is stored in SG-Mail, which is a Confidential system that lets you store Confidential collections of data.

## What kinds of forms can be on FormSG?

FormSG is not just digitising surveys and polls. We have digitised hundreds of application forms or e-services from MOM, IRAS, MOE and more. To view Examples of what forms officers have digitised with FormSG, log in and view the Examples tab on the top right of your dashboard.

## What is the price of using FormSG?

FormSG is free to use.

Forms that enable SingPass or CorpPass authentication will however have to pay for these external services. Standard SPCP rates apply and you should contact SPCP team directly to find out more.
