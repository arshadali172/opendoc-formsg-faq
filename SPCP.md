Note that if the E-service ID you provided is invalid then SPCP logins will not work. Note that the onus is on you to enter the appropriate E-service ID and it is up to you to a) attain the necessary approval to bill to this ID and b) verify the ID is correct.

## What's an E-service ID?

An e-service id is a unique billing ID given by the SingPass/CorpPass office to your department's finance team. All SingPass or CorpPass logins associated to your department's E-service id can then be easily charged to your department. If you don’t already have an E-service ID, you may ask your agency IT department to find an E-service ID you could reuse. If you insist on creating a new one, you may ask your IT department for the SingPass/CorpPass contact to be advised on relevant costs for creating an e-service ID for use on FormSG.

## When onboarding a new E-service ID, how do I test it on Staging? 

When it comes to testing your new E-service ID on Staging, you may email us at formsg@tech.gov.sg to test it for you.

## What is the price of using SingPass or CorpPass on my form?

FormSG simply passes down the base SPCP costs. The price of SingPass or CorpPass depends on the tier your agency is on. If your agency has a high volume of SPCP transactions each month, the price per login can be low. At the base tier, the price of SPCP is about $0.25 per login. SPCP also charges a fixed fee per month. For additional pricing info, pls contact the SPCP team directly.

## How do I track who is using my SingPass or CorpPass E-service ID?

On the top right of the home page, there’s a Billing panel. At this panel you may enter your E-service ID to view usage at this ID:

After entering the E-service ID, you may view forms that have used your E-service ID by month, and the number of logins each of these forms have used. You may also download this list onto an Excel.
