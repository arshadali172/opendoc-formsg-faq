# SingPass and CorpPass

## How do I enable SingPass or CorpPass on my form?

All you have to do is enter an E-service ID on the Settings tab of your form to enable SPCP. If the E-service ID you provided is invalid then SPCP logins will not work. Note that we do not validate this E-service ID in any way and it is up to you to a) attain the necessary approval to bill to this ID and b) verify the ID is correct.

## What's an E-service ID?

An e-service id is a unique billing ID given by the SingPass/CorpPass office to your department's finance team. All SingPass or CorpPass logins associated to your department's E-service id can then be easily charged to your department. If you don’t already have an E-service ID, you may ask your agency IT department to find an E-service ID you could reuse. If you insist on creating a new one, you may contact SPCP team to be advised on relevant costs. When it comes to testing your new E-service ID on Staging, you may email us ([formsg@tech.gov.sg](mailto:formsg@tech.gov.sg)) to test it for you.

## What is the price of using SingPass or CorpPass on my form?

FormSG simply passes down the base SPCP costs. Our SPCP logins are 1FA, hence SPCP team charges about $0.25 per login. They also charge a fixed price per month. If there is a high volume of logins at your E-service ID, the price per login goes down, and even becomes free, if your volume is high enough. Hence it’s recommended for you to reuse existing E-service IDs from your agency. For additional pricing info, pls contact the SPCP team directly.

## How do I track who is using my SingPass or CorpPass E-service ID?

On the top right of the home page, there’s a Billing panel. At this panel you may enter your E-service ID, which will display all SPCP enabled forms, form creators and number of logins.
