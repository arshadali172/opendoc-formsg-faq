# Tips

## How can I change the default logo displayed on FormSG form?

By default, the logo will display your agency's logo. However, you can modify this logo tot your own custom logo by changing the logo URRL. You also have the option to remove the logo. If you need to host your logo and get a URL, you can use imgbb to upload the logo and get a link to insert to the logo url box.

## What symbols can I add to the title of my form?

As of now, we do not allow symbols, with the exception of dashes - and underscores _ . If you require a parantheses, you use a dash instead.

## How to embed images on a FormSG form?

We don't have a feature to directly embed your image on the Form. Instead, you have to paste a URL (Link) to the image, which will be auto-hyperlinked and will open a new tab to display the image when a user clicks on it.

## Can I embed my form on my website?

You could and there is iframe code you can use, although it is not recommended as a) embedded iframes are not mobile optimised, b) the design of the form will likely be out of sync with your website (different fonts, colours), and c) it might adversely affect the SEO of your site/form. It's recommended you instead link a button on your site that points to your form to open in a new tab, which quite a few agencies have done.

## How do I automatically give my form fillers a receipt/summary of his response?

You may add an email field to your form, and enable "Email confirmation". If you do so, users who fill in their emails will receive an attachment with their completed response after submission for their record-keeping.

## My form requires many attachments, but there are limits on the attachment field. What do I do? 

Each attachment field can support either 1, 3 or 7 MB. And the entire form can support up to 7 MB. This means you can at most have 7 attachment fields on your form (1 MB x 7). If you require your users to submit more than 7 documents, you might want to create just one attachment field (7 MB x 1) and advise them to zip all their documents and upload that 1 attachment.

## How to allow the respondents to select more than 1 option?

Use *checkbox* to create your question. Other options such as *dropdown*, *radio* button will only allow respondent to choose 1 option.

## When do I use *radio* button vs *dropdown*? Aren't they equivalent?

For 5 or less choices, you should use a *radio* button feature, because you want to display all choices upfront for user to choose. For >5 choices, for e.g. country, displaying all options makes the form too lengthy, and *dropdown* is preferred in that situation.

## How do I upload multiple options to my *dropdown* field?

## Does FormSG support multiple pages, especially for a really long form? 

No we do not support multiple pages. Instead you can add *Headers* to your form to divide your form into sections.

## How do I know if the logic for the form is correct?

When you implement a new logic, you should test it yourself via the preview page. Make sure all logics make sense for your user before you deploy your form.
