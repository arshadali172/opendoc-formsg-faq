# TO ADD ON SUPPORT FORM


## Iâ€™ve signed up for an account but have not received the one-time password (OTP) needed to log in. What do I do?

Because of the firewalls that emails have to jump through to land in your government mailbox, it might take up to a few minutes to receive the OTP. If you still have not received it after a while, you might want to check other folders that is not your Inbox because of forwarding rules you might have previously set to route FormSG emails to. If you still cannot find that OTP, check your Junk folder. If it is still not there, kindly click the "Resend" button on the sign-in page to receive a new OTP.

## I am having issues with the Data Collation Tool. What do I do?

Most issues that you might be facing with collating your data can be solved by following the suggestions below:

1. Close Outlook before running the Data Collation Tool.
2. Switch to a modern browser such as Chrome, IE Edge or Firefox.
3. Delete the old .pst file and create a new .pst file, then upload it to the Data Collation Tool.
4. If step 1-3 do not work, zip up the .pst file and email it to us for investigation. We will use your .pst file for investigative purposes only and not circulate it past the FormSG team. If your .pst file is particularly sensitive, you may send us screenshots of the error instead.
