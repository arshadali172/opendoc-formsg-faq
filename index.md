# FormSG - User Guide

FormSG is self-service and typically does not need a guide. The best way to learn about the service is to [log in](https://form.gov.sg/#!/signin) and create your first form. 

There are three sections in this guide:
- First, you can find out recent updates to FormSG. 
- Second, if you are a new user, you might want to access "READ THIS FIRST" on the menu.
- Third, if you are looking for tips and tricks or workarounds to common issues, you may check out the Advanced Guide. If you have tips of your own to share, kindly browse the guide for instructions on how to update our guide too.
