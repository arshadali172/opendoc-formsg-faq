# FormSG - User Guide

FormSG is self-service and typically does not need a guide. The best way to learn about the service is to [log in](https://form.gov.sg/#!/signin) and create your first form. 

If you are a new user, you might want to access "READ THIS FIRST" on the left.
If you are already an experienced user but looking for tips and tricks or workarounds to common issues, you may check out the Advanced Guide.
